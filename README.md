# finalProject
This project is built using only in HTML and CSS. This is the beginning of my final project which will turn into a full-stack web application.

# What I want to do
I want to make a app that allows users to select a sport which will then display to them near by parks which will have its set of features including park reputation, difficulty, and account for people attended.

# How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS

# Lessons Learned:
I'm learning how to step by step document my progress while creating a full stack application
